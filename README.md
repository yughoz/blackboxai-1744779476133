# Geti Replica

## Project Overview
Geti Replica is a mobile application built with React Native and Expo. The application serves as a template that demonstrates the usage of basic UI components and state management. It features a simple user interface with a welcome message and a button that triggers an alert when pressed.

## Installation
To get started with Geti Replica, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd geti-replica
   ```
   
2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   You can start the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the Expo developer tools in your browser, allowing you to run the application on an Android emulator, iOS simulator, or even on a physical device using the Expo Go app.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can press the "Press Me" button to see an alert pop up. This serves as a basic interaction example within the application.

## Features
- A simple and clean user interface.
- Responsive layout using React Native and Expo.
- Button interaction with alert feedback.

## Project Structure
The following is the basic structure of the project:

```
